# Next.js Landing Page (`next-app`)

This project showcases a Figma-to-Code implementation, with a strong focus on pixel-perfect accuracy and faithful translation of the original design into code.

# React (Vite) Mini App (`vite-app`)

This project demonstrates a client-side application built with React and Vite. The focus is on functionality, state management, and interactivity rather than visual design.
